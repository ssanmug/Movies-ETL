# Creating a SQL Database using ETL Method

## Objective of the Project

### Purpose
We created a SQL database of movies released from 1990 to 2016 for Amazing Prime's hack-a-thon using the ETL method. We extracted raw data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, transformed and cleaned the data, and loaded it into a SQL database for users to easily access the information in the hopes of predicting the next big hit and helping Amazing Prime secure the movie rights.
